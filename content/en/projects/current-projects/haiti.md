**In partnership with the Haitian Education and Leadership Program (HELP), the Foundation has set up a Paré Scholar Program to support deserving young students in Haiti.**

Started in 2010, shortly after the earthquake, the Paré scholar program consists of:

*   Tuition-free classes at an internationally accredited university
*   Textbooks and supplies
*   Housing in HELP dorms and a living stipend
*   Academic advising and counseling, including computer literacy and English classes
*   Leadership & Citizenship training

For more information on HELP's program, click [here](http://uhelp.net/our-story/how-we-work/#sthash.ZRikysiZ.dpuf).

Our current Paré Scholar, Valencia Dorvilus, is studying agro-economics at Quisqueya University in Port-au-Prince. Her classes include botany, soil science and local traditional medicine.
