**In partnership with the Haitian Education and Leadership Program (HELP), the Foundation has set up a Paré Scholar Program to support deserving young students in Haiti.**

Started in 2010, shortly after the earthquake, the Paré scholar program consists of:

*   Tuition-free classes at an internationally accredited university
*   Textbooks and supplies
*   Housing in HELP dorms and a living stipend
*   Academic advising and counseling, including computer literacy and English classes
*   Leadership & Citizenship training

For more information on HELP's program, click [here](http://uhelp.net/our-story/how-we-work/#sthash.ZRikysiZ.dpuf).

We are currently supporting three Paré Scholars at HELP: Valencia Dorvilus (agro-economics), Sabine Joseph (agro-production), and Katiana Norvil (agro-economics), who is sponsored by the Jind family in Toronto. All three are deeply grateful to HELP for accompanying them in their studies. Academic successes aside, perhaps most important is their commitment to serving their community.  

Valencia, having taken part in the women’s empowerment group at HELP and coordinated the HELP dance club, reports that “…through all these activities, I was able to get involved in my surroundings and use my skills in service of my community.”
