## Mohawk Language Preservation

Since 2020, the Paré Foundation supports a Mohawk language program at Kanehsatà:ke, Quebec. The multi-year adult immersion program is offered by the Mohawk Language Custodian Association of Kanehsatà:ke and is designed to ensure the ancestral language survives and flourishes. The program has now graduated its first four students. All have found local employment, including jobs in health services and education, as well as a position as an announcer at Kanehsatà:ke’s radio station, RKR-FM.

Most of these adult students have no income stream or financial support to cover living expenses during their training. Any help is greatly appreciated. The Paré Foundation helps provide the support they need to achieve teaching proficiency in Mohawk. Students from this program will one day replace the last two current (very elderly) teachers at Kanehsatà:ke Elementary and High School.
