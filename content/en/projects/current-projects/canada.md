## Meet Tannis

We continue our support of our first Canadian student living in Canada, Tannis, an Indiginous woman who is completing her final semester of a Bachelor of Law from the University of Saskatchewan and is looking forward to graduating.

As she looks towards convocation Tannis is focusing on how she can integrate and apply her experiences as an Indigenous woman to help the government and legal systems better support and represent Indigenous issues in Canada and move towards reconciliation.
