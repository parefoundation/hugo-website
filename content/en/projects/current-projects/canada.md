## Meet Tannis

We continue our support of our first Canadian student living in Canada, Tannis, an Indiginous woman who is completing her final semester of a Bachelor of Law from the University of Saskatchewan and is looking forward to graduating.

As she looks towards convocation Tannis is focusing on how she can integrate and apply her experiences as an Indigenous woman to help the government and legal systems better support and represent Indigenous issues in Canada and move towards reconciliation.

## Mohawk Language Preservation

In 2020, the Par√© Foundation will help with living costs for adult students who are training to become teachers of Mohawk language and literacy.

Their living costs are currently severely underfunded and any help will be greatly appreciated.  The adult students, training at Kanehsatake to achieve teaching proficiency in Mohawk, will one day replace the last two current (very elderly) teachers at Kanehsatake Elementary and High School. Most of these adult students have no income stream or financial support to cover living expenses during this training. The support will provide them with the opportunity to help rebuild their traditional language and culture and the capacity to fill these vital positions.
