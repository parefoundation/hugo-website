## The Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars

**Led and managed by Antoinette Holland, the Foundation’s agent in Malawi, the program is focused on providing youth, and especially girls, the opportunity to continue their education despite their lack of resources.**

The Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Program (named in recognition of the Wright family’s long-term support of Antoinette (Toni) Holland’s work, and to honour Jim’s memory) continues to be the model on which new Paré Foundation projects are based.

Due to the nature of schooling in Sub-Saharan Africa, the chosen approach is to holistically support beneficiaries, covering both direct and indirect costs of education: tuition fees, textbooks, school supplies, mid-day meals, and transportation costs, if need be. This last item is particularly important when supporting girls’ education, given their vulnerability when traveling long distances in remote areas.

Three secondary school Jim and Nancy Wright scholars wrote their end-of-school exams in August and are currently awaiting their results. We hope to continue to support them through university, starting in September 2023.

Meanwhile, here is an update on our current (and recently graduated) university students:

* Esau (pictured below) graduated with a degree in Land Survey from Polytechnic University.
* Jacqueline graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Development Economics from LUNA (Lilongwe University of Agriculture Research).
* Isabelle is studying Earth Science at MUST (Malawi University of Science and Technology) and is currently in the field enjoying her attachment at the Mzuzu Geological Survey Department. In December she will be back in the classroom for her final year.
* Naomi is at St-Joseph's College of Nursing where she wrote her final exams in May and is now preparing for the nursing license exams at the end of November.
* Benson completed his year of apprenticeship in electrical engineering and returns to the classroom in January for his final year at Don Bosco Technical Institute.
* Our newest university student, Jane Chiona, is enrolled in a 4 year Bachelor of Arts program in media for development.

## Loyola Jesuit Secondary School

This is our fourth year working in partnership with [Loyola-Malawi](https://loyola-malawi.org/), in memory of Donald Paré, former President of the Paré Foundation, who was deeply committed to the Foundation’s mission, as well as the Jesuit ideal of forming “Women and Men for Others”. We continue to support our first cohort of 5 Paré scholars: four girls, one boy. We are committed to supporting these five students every year through to high school graduation, and beyond.

Loyola-Malawi is a Jesuit run school located in Kasungu district, a few hours north of Lilongwe, the capital. The school boasts beautiful grounds and a new building to welcome its students. Admission is based on merit alone. Run by the Zambia-Malawi Jesuit Province, Loyola strives to offer a ‘preferential option for the poor’* – in this case, high quality education to those that otherwise wouldn’t have access to such schooling. We at the Paré Foundation are thrilled to participate in that mission.

_*The term ‘preferential option for the poor’ is attributed to the Jesuits of Latin America, in the 1960s._
