Our collaboration with the Regenboog Foundation continues in Tiruvannamalai where the Par√© Foundation is proud to continue supporting Sujatha, a dedicated nursing student in Chennai, with her third year of a four-year course. 

Additionally, our sponsorship extends to 105 students across three evening schools, two of which serve children from the marginalized Irula tribal community. We are also delighted to congratulate Madhan Mohan, the founder of Regenboog India, for receiving recognition from the Governor of Tamil Nadu for his outstanding work in the community. This honor is a testament to his tireless commitment to improving the lives of those in need.

This [12-minute video](https://youtu.be/B_Z9_h3XsNY) provides a comprehensive look at the Regenboog Foundation's impactful work in education and community development in India.
