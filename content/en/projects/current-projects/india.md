Our collaboration with the Regenboog Foundation continues in Tiruvannamalai where the Paré Foundation is proud to continue supporting Sujatha, a dedicated nursing student in Chennai, who expects to graduate in a few months. 

Additionally, our sponsorship extends to 150 students across four evening schools, two of which serve children from the marginalized Irula tribal community. We are also delighted to congratulate Madhan Mohan, the founder of Regenboog India, for receiving recognition from the Governor of Tamil Nadu for his outstanding work in the community. This honor is a testament to his tireless commitment to improving the lives of those in need.

This [12-minute video](https://youtu.be/B_Z9_h3XsNY) provides a comprehensive look at the Regenboog Foundation's impactful work in education and community development in India.
