Our collaboration with the Regenboog Foundation continues in Tiruvannamalai where the Paré Foundation has the honour of supporting three new students: Keerthiga (Computer Science), Sakthivel (Chemistry), Abitha (Commerce).

Meanwhile, in 2021, Muthazhagi completed her Master's Degree in Medical Physics. Her sister, Vasanthazhagi, also supported by the Paré Foundation, is in her second year of a bachelor in Information Technology. Gayathri (pictured below) is in her 4th year of nursing. She is already hard at work helping with the vaccination effort.
