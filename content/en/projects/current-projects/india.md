## Meet Sathya

Our collaboration with the Regenboog Foundation continues in Tiruvannamalai where we most recently supported Sathya, a university student now doing a Masters of Social Work. She is a bright young woman who is eager to give back to her community.

We are now exploring new ways to support the efforts of the Regenboog Foundation as they work towards establishing an evening school for students who need academic support.
