After graduating in June 2020 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, Tannis opted to remain in Saskatoon. Going forward, she aims to help alleviate the over representation of Indigenous children in government care. She will be working to help Indigenous communities to implement Bill C-92 which will allow them to direct their own policies to ensure that their children remain within their respective families and communities.
