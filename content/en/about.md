**The Paré Foundation is a family foundation established by Alphonse Paré and Lucy Griffith’s nine children in 1984.**

## 1984-2005

In commemoration of Alphonse and Lucy’s dedication to education, the Foundation was set up to support schools and families in Canada and abroad. In the beginning, it was also active in the area of literary publication and supported the distribution of The Seeds, a family history.

## 2005-Present

Since 2005, the Paré Foundation’s activities have focused on supporting students in a variety of countries. Currently, the Foundation works with partners and agents in Malawi, Haiti, India, and Canada. The Paré Foundation has also supported short-term projects in Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Israel, and Uganda.

## Looking ahead

The Foundation’s projects center on investing in the education of children and youth, in particular. Given the demand-driven nature of the work of the Foundation, activities tend to vary depending on the needs of the individual student and the country context. The specificities of each investment are determined by the Foundation’s Board of Directors in consultation with the agents managing each project.
